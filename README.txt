This is my starter theme Drupal Theme for Drupal 7.x


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

TO INSTALL:

1.	Upload this folder and its contents into /sites/all/themes

2.	Enable and set as Default under /admin/build/themes

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTES:

This theme is meant to serve as a starter theme.

This theme is HTML5 with RDF support.  If you have the RDF module (core in 7.x)
turned on, you will notice that your page won't validate with the HTML5 
performance checker (as they say: "be aware that it may be unreliable, or not 
perfectly up to date with the latest development of some cutting-edge 
technologies"), which isn't up to date enough to validate all the extra
markup.

If you have any questions or problems with this theme please email me 
and I'll get you sorted out.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I created this starter theme based on the Framework starter theme by 
Andr√© Griffin (http://d7.andregriffin.com)
Its a great starter theme - I highly recommend it:
